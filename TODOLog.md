Enough is working that I feel happy committing it
- Reads shows from YAML file
- Parses out show info
- Parses All Workers list to get ID and Name pairs

Next:
- put that info into something useful, probably an SQLite database
- figure out useful schema for that db
- clean it up a little
- document some of the weirder bits of BS magic for my own sake. probably just in here.
